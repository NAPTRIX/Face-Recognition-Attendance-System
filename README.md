# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
A Python-based face recognition system using OpenCV for real-time attendance tracking. This script allows users to sign up by scanning their faces, log their entries and exits with timestamps, and manage their face data for efficient recognition. Ideal for small-scale attendance systems

## Features

- **Sign Up**: Register new users by capturing and storing their facial data.
- **Sign In**: Recognize and log users when they appear in front of the camera.
- **Face Management**: Delete registered faces as needed.
- **Attendance Logging**: Record entry and exit times with user names.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python FRAS.py
2. **Follow the Prompts.**

This project has been on hold for a long time, and I have just started to finish it. I will soon add a GUI and probably more features
